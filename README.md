🚀 GFG x NPCI: 60-Day POTD Challenge

This repository contains my daily solutions for the 60-Day Problem of the Day (POTD) Challenge on GeeksforGeeks, powered by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).

The goal of this challenge is to build consistency, master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and develop the logical mindset required for high-scale engineering environments.
